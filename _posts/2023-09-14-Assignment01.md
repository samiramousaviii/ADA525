**CAD Model**


The mold consists of four moveable arms which are connected to four adjustable walls with elastic surfaces that expand/detract alongside X- or Y-axis within a base to customize the shape and dimension of the mold. The mold base is designed in Fusion 360 program and will be 3D printed. As mentioned, walls will be adjusted by moveable arms.
