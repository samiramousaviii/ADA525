**Laser Cutting**




This assignment is to design a finger-joint box using Fusion 360. Creating the bottom surface was the first stage and this was carried out by creating a component and forming a rectangle with the desired dimensions. Subsequently, I generated a series of rectangles for the finger joints, mirroring them to align with both sides. This process was repeated for each side of the box. Once the design was complete, I extruded it to achieve the desired thickness.

After creating one side, I employed the mirror component command to duplicate it on the opposite side. To unify all the sides together, I utilized the combine command. To ensure there were no issues, I employed the component colour cycling toggle, which allowed me to identify any component overlapping. If such issues arose, I utilized the combine command with the cut operation to solve the issue.
