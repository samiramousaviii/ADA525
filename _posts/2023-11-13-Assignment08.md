**Web server 2**


This week's assignment was to extend our web application from the previous assignment to communicate with our prototypes. The goal was to establish a real-time data stream from the local website (the user defined parameters on the interactive fields of the website) and the prototype, besides visualizing the collected data dynamically on the website. For this purpose, I chose to implement serial communication between the web application and an Arduino prototype using a python code, creating a seamless connection for streaming engine positions.



**Client-side Java Script file**


***Visualization Method***


The main purpose of the project is visualizing the engine positions dynamically. To achieve this, I used the Chart.js library to create a bar chart that visually represents the positions of two engines. The chart updates in real-time as new data are received, providing an intuitive and immediate understanding of the prototype's status.

***User Input Validation***


To ensure the integrity of the data sent to the server, I implemented input validation on the client side. This prevents users from entering invalid engine positions, ensuring that the data sent to the prototype accurately represent the acceptable range (0-180) for Servo motors implemented in the prototype.

**Implementation**


***Web Application***


The front end of the web application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input engine positions, and upon clicking the "Send" button, the data is not only updated on the chart in real-time but also transmitted to the server via a POST request.

***Server***


The server, built with Node.js and Express, receives the data and responds with a success message. The server also provides an endpoint for the client to retrieve the latest engine positions.

**Serial Communication with Arduino**


The Python script establishes a serial connection with the Arduino prototype through COM7 port. It checks for updates from the web application every second and sends the engine positions to the Arduino. This bidirectional communication ensures synchronization between the web application and the physical prototype.

**Arduino Code**



Finally, the Arduino code defines the behaviour of the physical prototype. It includes the control of LEDs, a button to cycle through different states, and the adjustment of servo motors representing engine positions. There are some minor adjustments in this that will be implemented in the final project.
