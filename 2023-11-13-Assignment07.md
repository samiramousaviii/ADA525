**Web server 1**



This weeks assignment was to develop a web application with a user interface accessible through a web browser. This interface should retrieve information from the server using HTTP get requests and present it on the browser screen. 

**Topic for web browser**


A web browser feature will be designed to use a Chart.js bar chart to show users how much time is left until midnight. The chart updates every second, giving a real-time countdown experience in a visually easy-to-understand way.

**Project set-up**


A new project directory for this assignment was created and “npm init” was run to initialize the Node.js project. Afterwards “express” and “chart.js” dependencies were installed by following command:

**Creating a server**


A “server.js” file is created in the main project directory, and a basic Express server was created to serve static files and respond to the HTTP get requests (local port 3000 will be used later in this assignment). As shown below, an API route is also included to fetch data.

**Crating HTML and Frontend scripts**


A public directory is created and an HTML file which is called “index.html” in this assignment has been added:

Afterwards, frontend scripts are added to a file in this folder called “script.js”:

In line 41, “fetchData” is implemented to fetch data from the server, calculate the time remaining until midnight, and update both the bar chart and a data container. The time calculation involves converting milliseconds to hours, minutes, and seconds. The chart and data container are visually updated to reflect the current time as shown below:

**References and useful hints**


As a beginner in Node.js, this assignment presented a unique challenge for me. With no prior experience, I went through the class materials Frikk [1] provided, studied relevant documentations, and got help from online resources [2, 3] to clarify commands and details about coding concepts. This involved extensive research, but now I feel more confident to handle this assignment with what I've learned.
